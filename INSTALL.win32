1. Install MinGW and MSYS;
2. Install mingw-ibpdcurses and msys-libregex;
3. copy msys-libregex into MinGW directory;
4. Add "#define __MSDOS__ " and "#define __DJGPP__" into config.h.in;
5. in MSYS shell, run ./configure
- 6. change "CURSES_LIBS = -lcurses" to "CURSES_LIBS = -lpdcurses" in *all* Makefiles
+ 6 use command "make CURSES_LIBS=-lpdcurses" to make project



Note: msys-libregex has bug, will crash, I use regex-spencer now.
