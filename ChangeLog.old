(2003/09/04 - broeker) Release of CVS HEAD version as (back-labelled) version
		       version 15.5.
(2003/08/14 - broeker) Cleaned up man page, INSTALL and TODO files.
(2003/08/14 - broeker) Have configure check for <regex.h>.  Bail out if none
	               found.
(2003/08/14 - broeker) New options --help and --version.
(2003/06/12 - broeker) New option -v to output progress updates even in
		       line mode.  To be used by interface kscope.
(2003/06/02 - broeker) Use the basename of files only to test for SCCS/RCS
	               files in -R traversal.
(2003/04/29 - broeker) Check that a src file is a regular file before trying to
	               scan it.  Change from S_IFDIR/S_IFREG bit tests to 
		       macros S_ISDIR/S_ISREG.
(2003/03/05 - broeker) Remove '-y' option from pipe call to utility "sort".
	               It's long since deprecated, and some modern versions
		       will barf seeing it.
(2003/03/02 - broeker) Don't restrict to 14 character filenames any longer.
(2003/01/23 - broeker) Update to latest auto* tools.  First step towards
                       integration of GNOME GUI version.
(2002/12/11 - broeker) Get rid of deprecated ={...} style actions in egrep.y.
	               Use plain {...} instead.
(2002/10/29 - broeker) Fix bug #588671: disprefs was still 0 if only 1 very
	               long reference output shown by curses display.
(2002/08/27 - broeker) Fix bug #600494: use mygetenv() for HOME, and provide
	               a fall-back if it's not there.
(2002/08/15 - broeker) DOS/Cygwin bugfix: avoid setmode() if fopen() failed.
(2002/07/27 - broeker) Yet another round of Cygwin-related fixes.  Do the 
		       #include <fcntl.h> early enough, so checks for 
		       O_BINARY work.  Make sure that myexit() is always
		       called instead of calling exit() directly.  Add
		       AC_EXEEXT to configure.in.
(2002/07/10 - broeker) Get rid of assumption about values of access()
	               parameters W_OK and R_OK --- make assumptions only 
		       if system doesn't supply values.  Add check for 
		       existence of lstat(); fall back to stat() if not
		       available.  Avoid confusion of DOS' setmode() with
		       BSD function of same name...
(2002/07/07 - broeker) Delete tempfile before redirecting to it, to avoid 
	               complaints about clobbering from poorly configured 
		       default shells.
(2002/06/20 - broeker) Fix operation of -C -L0 if pattern contains any
	               upper-case characters.
(2002/06/20 - broeker) Fix handling of non-standard whitespace in Flex 
	               scanner. Should make it more robust against DOS text
		       files that ended up on a Unix box, and other unexpected
		       characters, and avoid SF bug #508060.
(2002/03/16 - broeker) Fix namelist handling bug: ./ in paths would cause 
	               search for next name to fail (SF bug #529618). 
		       -I/-p and their argument no longer have to be in 
		       one line inside the namelist file, and -I pathname
		       can now be quote-escaped.
(2002/03/13 - broeker) Add AC_PREREQ() call to configure.in.  Enables Cygwin
	               automagic hack to call the right autoconf for us.
(2002/03/13 - broeker) Replace all references to manpage 'regcmp(3X)' in
	               messages and comments by regcomp(3), which is what 
		       cscope actually uses.
(2002/03/08 - broeker) Fix completely broken handling of filenames with blanks
	               in namelist files.  Use fgets + sscanf, not fscanf, and
		       don't split at whitespace inside "" quotes.
(2001/01/04 - broeker) Survive Cygwin "binmode" mounted filesystems by 
	               explicitly forcing text mode for source files.
(2002/01/02 - broeker) Updated files supplied or generated by automake to 
	               version 1.4-p5, the current recommended version in the
		       1.4 series.
(2002/01/02 - broeker) Add handling of "quoted filenames with blanks in" in
	               namelist files
(2001/11/22 - broeker) Quell some compiler warnings caused by missing #includes
	               and private declarations of system library functions.
(2001/10/30 - petrs)   Added Joe Steffen to author's list as the creator.
(2001/10/19 - broeker) Replace usages of freopen() by fclose()/fopen() pairs
		       to work around bug in some Linux libc constellation.
(2001/10/10 - broeker) Remove unused argument 'name' of addsrcfile() function.
	               Alternative buffer overflow protection scheme, using
		       "%.*s" format specifiers in ordinary sprintf(); now used
		       throughout dir.c.
(2001/10/09 - valentin) Prevention of a possible buffer overflow.
(2001/09/27 - broeker) Added autoconf test to use Cygwin's separate
                       -lregex. The regcomp() in libc is not what we want.
(2001/09/13 - broeker) Move chunk for malformed CPP directives further down, so
	               it won't incorrectly eat up #else or #endif directives.
		       Fixes bug #460345.
(2001/08/27 - broeker) Add C++-style comments to {comment} pattern. Fixes
	               bug #455441: C++ comments in the middle of a function 
		       definition caused it not be recognized.
(2001/08/15 - broeker) Zero out 'disprefs' whenever the count of references, 
	               'totallines' is set to zero. This makes sure that you 
		       can't <Tab> into the selection area if there's nothing 
		       in it.
(2001/08/13 - jcduell) Revisited inverted index file name fixup routines.
                       (Patch #444669 from SourceForge).
(2001/08/03 - broeker) Use %option noyywrap in fscanner.l to avoid problems
	               with broken flex installations that can't find -lfl. 
(2001/07/12 - dixon)   Updated INSTALL with new configure info for HP-UX.
(2001/07/11 - broeker) Fixed #if syntax glitch in cohrs' SUNOS change.
(2001/07/09 - petrs)   Substituted lstat() for stat() to prevent core
                       dumps on looping symbolic references.
(2001/07/06 - broeker) Code dealing with database creation ripped out of
		       main.c and moved to a new module build.c. New
		       header file build.h to go with it.
(2001/07/05 - cohrs)   LEX and SUNOS fix for scanner.
(2001/07/05 - broeker) Put in lots of 'static' keywords, added prototypes.
(2001/07/05 - broeker) Renamed pclose() function to mypclose(), in order not to
	               cause a conflict with system function having the same
		       name.
(2001/07/05 - broeker) Centralisation of BSDism configuration stuff. Removal of
	               some remaining external prototypes from .c files, where
		       they should never be. Added multiple inclusion guards
		       to all headers. Ask for feature instead of testing a 
		       list of platform-#defines, wherever possible.
(2001/07/05 - broeker) Some post-last-minute DOS/DJGPP build fixes.
(2001/07/03 - petrs)   Updated the version strings to 16.0a.
(2001/07/02 - petrs)   Updated the contrib/README to include xcscope.
(2001/07/02 - petrs)   15.3 version name, man page update, README update.
                       Make dist includes webcscope directory.
(2001/06/29 - ragho)   webcscope added to contrib 
(2001/06/29 - broeker) Re-formatted README, and added a tip working around 
	               buggy libcurses on HP-UX 10.
(2001/06/29 - broeker) Oversight in packages/MSDOS/djmake.bat fixed.	
(2001/06/28 - darrylo) Updated xcscope.el to include GNU Emacs fixes and
		       fuzzy pattern matching.  Updated docs in xcscope.el.
(2001/06/28 - broeker) Added files in packages/MSDOS that help compiling
		       cscope on MSDOS using the DJGPP compiler.
(2001/06/28 - broeker) Add test for existence of <sys/termios.h> header,
		       to protect platforms that don't have it.
(2001/06/27 - broeker) Yet another set of automake/autoconf changes. 
                       Regenerated auto* files checked in, too. We are
		       'make distcheck' ready, now. Added 'ylwrap' to
		       CVS.
(2001/06/26 - broeker) Changed lex/flex handling in automake/autoconf setup
	               to make 'make distcheck' work cleanly: added new
		       files scanner.h and lookup.h to list of sources. 
		       Made sure both scanner.l and fscanner.l end up in the
		       distribution tarball, as they should.  Removed some
		       quotes from definition of ACNU_DECL_YYTEXT in 
		       configure.in which confused autoheader.
(2001/06/25 - broeker) Change handling of tag-less enums to same method as
	               used in fscanner.l since 2001/06/19.
(2001/06/25 - broeker) Fix SF bug #435535: two uses of yytext[] had been left 
	               over in fscanner.l, causing incorrect compression of
		       keywords #define and #include.
(2001/06/19 - broeker) More bugfixes and changes to flex scanner. Handling
	               of preprocessing directives treats whitespace and
		       garbage after the keyword more gently. It also avoids
		       treating lex patterns as preprocessing directives. And 
		       enum/struct/union definitions without a tag are no
		       longer written out to the database, which should help
		       to get rid of 'cannot get sourceline' error messages.
		       Also a new rule to compress whitespace sequences by
		       means of a flex rule (should to be faster than 
		       hand-coding).
(2001/06/15 - broeker) Bugfix to flex scanner: comments after an #endif, 
	               without any whitespace in between, would be dumped
		       to stdout.
(2001/06/15 - broeker) Minor documentation glitch in manpage and online help
	               screen: set of keys to choose from matches found 
		       contains 0-9, not 1-9. 
(2001/06/01 - broeker) New version of fscanner.l, and lots of
	               small changes to other source files, too. Avoids
		       (ab)use of yytext[] as a temporary buffer by unrelated
		       pieces of code, and changes exported variables of the
		       scanned line from lex-internal yyleng and my_yyleng 
		       to my_yytext and my_yyleng. New header files scanner.h
		       and lookup.h. 
(2001/06/01 - broeker) Fix 64bit-related bug in invlib.c that caused the symbol
                       'sun' to not be found on DigitalUnix/Alpha platform.
(2001/05/30 - dixon) arrow and editing keys can be now used at the input line
(2001/05/30 - duell) invname database issue fix.
(2001/05/20 - garret)  Fixed some mishaps in ocs.
(2001/04/30 - broeker) Fixed signed char casting bug in dicode compression. 
	               Encapsulated dicode compression idioms into macros
		       IS_A_DICODE() and DICODE_COMPRESS().
(2001/04/26 - ogawa) Fix for posterr
(2001/04/26 - sorfa) Fixed a SIGSEGV in linemode in find.c. Thanks to OGAWA Hirofumi
                     for pointing out the problem.
(2001/04/24 - slutz) STMTMAX increased to 10000
(2001/03/29 - broeker) Some further MSDOS/DJGPP patches. Close file 
	               'refsfound' before unlinking it. Avoid calling curses
 	               function nonl().  Replace fork/exec/wait machinery in 
	               exec.c by call to lib function spawnvp().
(2001/03/28 - broeker) Added flex-able version of scanner.l to the project, as
	               file src/fscanner.l. Changed configure.in and 
		       src/Makefile.am to use it if using 'flex'.
(2001/03/27 - broeker) Remove 'extern' declaration of yylval from
                       egrep.y:yylex(). It's not needed, as this is inside the
	               Yacc source itself, where the definition of yylval is
	               directly visible, and it causes problems by incompatible
	               redefinition on Alpha/DigitalUnix using yacc.
(2001/03/12 - broeker) Some minor changes for compiling cscope with DJGPP, the
	               MSDOG port of GCC. Mainly non-availability of some
		       Unix features like CLOSE_ON_EXEC for files, and SIGTSTP.
(2001/03/12 - broeker) Added 'b' flags and O_BINARY bits to all file-opening
                       calls for (potentially) binary data files, to allow 
		       cscope to work on DOS-style platforms. Moved vpopen()
		       and vpfopen() prototypes into vp.h.
(2001/03/12 - broeker) rename 'basename' to 'mybasename' --- avoid XPG4
                       name conflict
(2001/02/12 - duell) man page update for CSCOPE_* information
(2001/02/09 - duell & hull) Support for CSCOPE_EDITOR, CSCOPE_LINEFLAG and
                            CSCOPE_LINEFLAGS_AFTER_FILE
(2001/02/09 - petrs) Updated version number to 15.2b (for beta)
(2001/02/09 - chuck & wilfredo) Darwin support
(2001/01/24 - petrs) Replaced new style C comments, i.e. //
(2000/12/12 - petrs) packages/cscope.spec has now no local directory
(2000/12/12 - petrs) contrib/ocs now checks that cscope is in $PATH
(2000/12/11 - frost) Safety feature in mypopen.c
(2000/11/28 - blank) More FreeBSD support
(2000/11/23 - broeker) Added check for snprintf() to configure.in
(2000/11/22 - petrs) Updated date to cscope.1 man page and retagged the file
(2000/11/22 - petrs) Tagged cvs tree as v15_1
(2000/11/21 - petrs) Added UnixWare 7 packaging scripts
(2000/11/20 - petrs) 15.1 version name, man page update, README update
(2000/10/09 - atrn) better FreeBSD support
(2000/10/02 - fritsch) better BeOS support
(2000/10/02 - salz) -i now accepts '-' for a list of files from stdio
(2000/09/19 - brent) fixed -R to handle similarly named files
(2000/05/31 - mascott) ncurses.h gets picked up correctly for FreeBSD
(2000/05/18 - hops) display errors via varargs posterr(ap, ..)
                    start changing sprintfs to snprintfs
                    buildonly not go into curses - set linemode 
                        - fixes buildonly coredump
                    explicitly initialise some booleans in main.c
                    handle error messages nicely - curses msgline2 line 
                    or stdout - using snprintf+posterr(buf). 
                    Clear msg2 line  on ^L command.c.
                    Support BS in getline()  input.c.
                    Add build support for contrib dir.
(2000/05/18 - broeker) move declarations of invlib.c functions to invlib.h,
                       from global.h
(2000/05/18 - broeker) it's 'myylineno', not 'yylineno'
(2000/05/18 - broeker) don't #include <config.h>, but "config.h" --
                       it's not a system header file, after all.
(2000/05/18 - broeker) don't #include "global.h" from egrep.y -- the
                       extern declaration for yylex() only confuses
                       it, and it doesn't need most of "global.h",
                       anyway.
(2000/05/18 - broeker) no more 'extern' declaration in .c files -- they
                       belong into the headers. For now, most of them move to
                       "global.h".
(2000/05/18 - broeker) don't cast function pointers -- make all the
                       find*() function follow the same prototype,
                       instead. This affects their definitions, too.
(2000/05/17 - sharpe) progress bar, tab between line selection and option,
                      new support for more than nine line selections
(2000/05/15 - petr) version 15.0bl3 now, spec file change
(2000/05/10 - klausner) NetBSD current support
(2000/05/09 - petr) added packages directory and cscope.spec file
(2000/05/09 - broeker) alloc.c, invlib.c, invlib.h: initial 64bit support
(2000/05/05 - broeker) global.h, invlib.c: change return type of invterm to
	                'long'
(2000/05/05 - broeker) remove superfluous casts from and to type 'void *'
                       in calls to malloc() family of routines
(2000/05/04 - hops) configure: find flex libs in /usr/local, 
                    cmdline args to specify use of flex/lex, yacc/byacc/bison
(2000/05/03 - broeker) some code cleanup
(2000/05/03 - broeker) more code cleanup and -Wall warnings removal

(2000/05/01 - petr) Updated configure.in (and configure) to handle UW7
(2000/04/28 - petr) Fixed another -q failure on large data
(2000/04/28 - petr) Fixed -q failure
(2000/04/27 - brent) Add support for 3 letter suffixes (currently .tcc)
(2000/04/27 - brent) Add -R option to recurse subdirectories

(2000/04/27 - uzi) Added autoconf and restructure directories
(2000/04/26 - petr) Tagged current source as v15_0_bl1 before autoconf support
(2000/04/26 - darrylo) minor fixs in crossref.c and scanner.l
(2000/04/26 - petr) changed spelling of psuedo to pseudo in scanner.l
(2000/04/26 - uzi) Changes in preparation of autoconf/automake setup
(2000/04/26 - uzi) Added k to terse args in cscope man page
(2000/04/25 - petr) Added h to terse args in cscope man page
(2000/04/25 - petr) Fixed build break with flex
(2000/04/25 - petr) Added better support for non-flex lex

(2000/04/21 - petr) Created new build directory with system specific makefiles
(2000/04/20 - uzi) -k kernel option and code clean up (from K&R C to ANSI C)
(2000/04/20 - edgar) prevention of cscope.out corruption and correct dboffset calulation
(2000/04/20 - martin) Use 'env LC_ALL=C sort' rather than 'LC_ALL=C sort' for sorting
(2000/04/19 - petr) Added README/NEWS/AUTHORS files
